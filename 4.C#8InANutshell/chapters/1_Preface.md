# Preface

C# 8.0 represents the seventh major update to Microsoft's flagship programming language,positioning C# as a language with unusual flexibility and breadth. At one end, it offers high-level abstractions such as query expressions and asynchronous continuations,whereas at the other end, it allows low-level efficiency through constructs such as custom value types and optional pointers.

The price of this growth is that there's more than ever to learn.Although tools such as Microsoft's IntelliSense-and online references-are excellent in helping you on the job,they presume an existing map of conceptual knowledge in a concise and unified style-free if clutter and long introductions.

Like the past five editions, *C# 8.0 in a Nutshell* is organized around concepts and use cases,making it friendly both so sequential reading and to random browsing. It also plumbs significant depths while assuming only basic background knowledge,making it accessible to intermediate as well as advanced readers.

This book covers C#, the Common Language Runtime(CLR), and the essential .NET Core assemblies. We've chosen this focus to allow space for difficult topics such as concurrency, security, and access to operating system functionality-without compromising depth or readability. Features new to C# 8 are flagged so that you can also use this book as a reference for C# 7.
